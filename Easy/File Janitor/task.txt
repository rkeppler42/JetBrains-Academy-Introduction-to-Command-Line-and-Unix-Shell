Task 1:

Objectives

In this stage, write a Bash script that outputs two lines of text with a description of the script:

    The first line must contain the words File Janitor, which is our script's name, and the year of its creation;
    The second line must contain the words Powered by Bash to indicate that our script is a Bash script. Do not forget to add the path to the script interpreter at the beginning of the script!

Example

The line starting with $ followed by a space represents the command in the terminal input. Note that it is not a part of the script output.

$ ./file-janitor.sh
File Janitor, 2022
Powered by Bash
